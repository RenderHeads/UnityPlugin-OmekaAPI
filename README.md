# Omeka S API support for Unity3D

This repo contains an implementation of the Omeka API for Unity3D to retrieve content from an Omeka System and use it within unity.

## What is [Omeka](https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s)?
Omeka S is a web publication system for universities, galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. It consists of a local network of independently curated exhibits sharing a collaboratively built pool of items, media, and their metadata.

## Current Functionality
- Read-only support 
- Api search of *Item Sets, Items and Media*
- Dublin Core Vocabulary

## Dependencies
- The implementation relies of NewtonSoft Json.Net as deserialization of the Json-LD information
